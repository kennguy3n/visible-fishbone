# Traffic Classification and Steering Framework

> Architecture document for the ShieldNet Gateway (SNG) traffic
> classification engine. Companion to `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.4a.

## 1. Motivation

A naive "inspect everything in the cloud" policy is fatal for SME
economics: at 100% cloud-proxied traffic, even a 50-user tenant
generates enough TLS-decrypt CPU and egress bandwidth to wipe out
the gross margin SNG depends on.

The classification engine inverts the default: every flow is
slotted into one of six **traffic classes** and steered to the
**cheapest enforcement path that still provides adequate
protection**. The result is the same security outcome as cloud
inspection for high-risk flows (~10-20% of traffic) while letting
the well-known 70-80% — Microsoft 365, Google, YouTube, OS
updates, etc. — bypass the cloud proxy entirely.

The framework is deployment-mode-aware. The same tenant policy
produces different steering actions for a branch with an edge VM
than for a home-office user behind the agent, because the set of
cost-effective enforcement points is different in each case.

## 2. The Six Traffic Classes

| Class | Protection Applied | Telemetry | Typical % of SME Traffic |
|---|---|---|---|
| `trusted_direct` | DNS verification + cert-pin + IP-range binding. **No** TLS decryption, **no** proxy. | Metadata only (5-tuple, bytes, SNI, app id, verdict) | 35-50% |
| `trusted_media_bypass` | DNS verification + cert-pin. Same as `trusted_direct` but tuned for high-bandwidth media/CDN flows that would saturate the proxy. | Metadata only; coarse-grained sampling | 20-30% |
| `inspect_lite` | DNS verification + URL category lookup. **No** TLS decryption. Used for top-Alexa domains, well-known CDNs, banking. | Metadata + URL-cat verdict | 10-20% |
| `inspect_full` | Full SWG: TLS decrypt, URL-cat, malware verdict, AV scan, IPS, DLP, content filtering. | Metadata + (optionally) decrypted payload, when tenant policy opts in. | 10-20% |
| `tunnel_private` | mTLS overlay to a tenant-private destination (ZTNA app, internal LOB system). No inspection — point-to-point encrypted. | Metadata + ZTNA decision record | 1-5% |
| `block` | Connection refused at the earliest possible enforcement point (DNS sink, edge drop, agent block). | Block event with reason | < 5% |

The class assignment for a flow is the **effective traffic class**
— the per-tenant override (if any), falling back to the global
app-registry classification, falling back to `inspect_full` when
no classification exists.

## 3. Steering Behavior by Deployment Mode

A traffic class names *what protection is appropriate*. The
deployment mode determines *where that protection is enforced*.

|  | `branch` (edge VM) | `hub` (inter-site) | `cloud_only` (no on-prem) | `home_office` (agent only) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `trusted_direct` | Edge ASIC fast-path. NGFW logs metadata, IPS skipped, SWG bypassed. | Same as branch when traffic terminates at hub. | Endpoint stub → direct internet egress. Agent verifies cert pin locally. | Direct internet egress from the host NIC; agent verifies cert pin + IP range. |
| `trusted_media_bypass` | Same as `trusted_direct` but logged at sampled rate to control telemetry cost. | Same as branch. | Direct egress, sampled telemetry. | Direct egress, sampled telemetry. |
| `inspect_lite` | Edge SWG: URL-cat hit only, no TLS-MITM, no AV scan. | Forwarded to spoke branch for SWG. | Endpoint sends DNS to cloud DNS proxy for category lookup; HTTPS itself goes direct. | Same as `cloud_only`. |
| `inspect_full` | Edge SWG: full TLS decrypt + AV + IPS. CPU stays on the customer's VM. | Forwarded to spoke branch (full SWG runs at the spoke). | Endpoint tunnels HTTPS to the regional cloud PoP for full inspection. | Same as `cloud_only`. This is the **only** class that pays full cloud-egress + decrypt cost. |
| `tunnel_private` | Edge SD-WAN overlay tunnel to the private destination. | Same as branch; hub may relay if the destination sits at another site. | Endpoint runs ZTNA client to the private destination directly. | Same as `cloud_only`. |
| `block` | Dropped at NGFW / DNS sink before the flow leaves the LAN. | Dropped at hub. | DNS sink at the endpoint resolver; if it bypasses DNS, edge / cloud agent drops the TCP SYN. | Same as `cloud_only`. |

The compiler emits one steering rule set per (deployment-mode,
traffic-class) pair into the relevant bundle:

- **Edge bundle** (`branch`, `hub`): full per-class table — DNS
  allowlists, SWG bypass lists, IPS skip lists, SD-WAN
  app-class mappings.
- **Endpoint bundle** (`cloud_only`, `home_office`,
  agent-on-managed): DNS verification lists + per-class steering
  decisions (which class goes direct vs. cloud proxy vs. tunnel).
- **Cloud bundle**: the accept list (only `inspect_full` and
  `tunnel_private` arrive here) plus the reject/redirect rules
  for traffic that should never have been sent to the proxy.
- **Mobile bundle**: ZTNA destinations + tunnel decisions only —
  no SWG or IPS classes, because the mobile platform doesn't
  carry that data path.

## 4. Safety Guarantees

A trusted class is only as safe as the binding from name to
identity. The framework enforces three layers before honoring a
`trusted_*` decision:

1. **DNS verification.** The endpoint / edge resolves the domain
   against a trusted DNSSEC-validating resolver. If resolution
   fails or returns SERVFAIL, the flow falls back to
   `inspect_full` (fail-closed).
2. **Cert-pin validation.** The TLS handshake's certificate
   chain is hashed and matched against the
   `app_registry.cert_pins` set for the app. A mismatch demotes
   the live flow to `inspect_full` and emits a
   `cert_pin_mismatch` event into the demotion engine.
3. **Domain-to-IP binding.** The destination IP must fall inside
   the `app_registry.ip_ranges` declared for the app. A
   mismatch is *especially* suspect for a trusted class because
   it suggests DNS spoofing or a tunneled exfiltration channel
   wearing a known-app SNI. Mismatch demotes the flow and
   feeds the demotion engine.

The fail-safe direction is always toward `inspect_full`. A
trusted classification can be demoted to inspect; an inspect
classification can never be silently promoted to trusted.

## 5. Demotion Rules

Demotion is the runtime response to evidence that a previously
trusted classification is currently unsafe. The demotion engine
(`internal/service/appdb/demotion.go`) listens on four signals:

| Trigger | Demotion Scope | TTL |
|---|---|---|
| Threat feed hit (NATS `sng.intel.dns`/`sng.intel.ip`) | Global, all tenants | Permanent until cleared by operator |
| Cert-pin mismatch ≥ N devices in time window | Global if ≥ M tenants observe; tenant-scoped otherwise | 7 days auto-expire; operator confirm to make permanent. The longer-than-other-signals TTL avoids flapping when a vendor rotates its certificate chain ahead of an SNG catalog refresh. |
| IP range mismatch | Tenant-scoped | 6h auto-expire |
| Baseline-model anomaly (exfil pattern on trusted app) | Tenant-scoped | 48h auto-expire |

Every demotion is:

- **Immediate.** Pushed via NATS subject `sng.appdb.demotions` to
  every edge / agent receiver subscribed to the tenant.
- **Audited.** Inserted into `audit_log` with action
  `app.demoted` and the trigger reason.
- **Operator-notifiable.** Fires the `app.demoted` webhook event
  on every subscribed endpoint.
- **Auto-expiring** (except threat-feed permanent demotions).
  When the TTL elapses the engine clears the override; the
  operator can confirm earlier to make the demotion permanent.

## 6. Cost Analysis

The cost difference between classes is the entire motivation for
the framework. Approximate per-GB egress + processing cost in a
cloud-only deployment:

| Class | Cloud Egress | Decrypt CPU | URL-Cat / AV | Net Cost / GB |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `trusted_direct` | $0 (direct ISP egress) | $0 | $0 | ~$0.00 |
| `trusted_media_bypass` | $0 | $0 | $0 | ~$0.00 |
| `inspect_lite` | $0 (DNS lookup only) | $0 | ~$0.001 | ~$0.001 |
| `inspect_full` | ~$0.09 (typical AWS NAT) | ~$0.03 | ~$0.005 | ~$0.125 |
| `tunnel_private` | $0.01 (overlay only) | $0 | $0 | ~$0.01 |
| `block` | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |

For a 100-user tenant generating ~1 TB/month, a naive
"everything through the cloud" policy costs ~$125/mo just in
inspection cost. Smart classification with the default mix
(50% trusted, 25% media bypass, 15% inspect-full, 10% other)
brings that to ~$22/mo — an 82% reduction without compromising
the protection actually applied to risky traffic.

For branch deployments the saving accrues differently: the
edge VM's CPU budget is no longer overwhelmed by URL-cat lookups
for every YouTube chunk, and the SD-WAN MPLS bill is unchanged
because trusted classes egress directly from the local internet
circuit.

## 7. App Registry — Schema Overview

The classification database has two layers:

- **`app_registry`** — curated global database of well-known
  apps (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Zoom, Netflix, …),
  shipped as system-managed data and refreshed by a periodic
  sync job that pulls vendor-published endpoint lists.
- **`app_registry_overrides`** — per-tenant overrides allowing
  the operator to promote (e.g. trust an internally-vetted
  vendor) or demote (e.g. force a SaaS through `inspect_full`
  for compliance reasons) any classification.

Tenant resolution is left-fold: tenant override wins, otherwise
global registry wins, otherwise fall back to `inspect_full`.

The schema is defined in `migrations/008_app_registry.up.sql`;
RLS is enabled on `app_registry_overrides` following the same
`sng.tenant_id` GUC pattern as every other tenant-scoped table
on the control plane (see [`docs/deploy.md`](./deploy.md)). The
`app_registry` table is intentionally **global** (no RLS) — it
is the same curated dataset for every tenant.

### 7.1 Region-aware trusted-app lists (Session 2B)

Some trusted apps are only relevant to one geography — Grab and
the SEA regional banks, Careem and the GCC gov portals, Swiss
Post and the DACH banks. Shipping them globally would either
leak one region's trust posture to every tenant or force the
operator to curate per-tenant overrides by hand. Instead the
registry carries a **region scope**:

- A global-scope row (`scope = 'global'`) applies to every
  tenant — the existing behaviour, unchanged.
- A regional-scope row (`scope = 'regional'`) carries a
  `regions[]` set and applies **only** to tenants in a matching
  region group.

Matching normalises every `regions[]` entry and the tenant's own
region marker through the shared
[`internal/region`](../internal/region) taxonomy, which maps ISO
country codes / cities / AWS regions to the **SEA / GCC / DACH**
groups. Crucially it is **ISO-code-driven**: broad continental
codes (`APAC`, `EU`, `MENA`) deliberately resolve to *no* group,
because one broad code spans multiple groups (`EU ⊋ DACH`) and
mapping it would leak a region's list across borders. So a row
seeded `{APAC, SG, ID}` matches SEA tenants via `SG`/`ID`; the
bare `APAC` token matches nothing on its own.

Resolution stays fail-safe and extends the left-fold of §7:

1. A tenant override still wins outright (it is explicit operator
   intent and is not region-filtered).
2. A regional global-catalog row is consulted **only** when the
   tenant's region group is known *and* listed; otherwise the row
   is skipped, the app falls through to the global baseline, and —
   absent any other match — lands on `inspect_full`.
3. When no region resolver is wired, or the tenant's region can't
   be resolved, **all** regional rows are skipped. The tenant is
   classified with global apps only — conservative (an
   unclassifiable app is inspected, not blindly trusted) and never
   cross-region.

The regional dimension is enforced in `appAppliesToRegion` /
`filterAppsByRegion` and applied in `ResolveTrafficClass`,
`NewSteeringSnapshot`, and `ListEffective`, so the edge bundle, the
live resolver, and the operator-facing effective list all agree.
The seeds live in `migrations/047_app_registry_regional_seed.up.sql`
(idempotent, `ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING`), following the
broad-code-plus-ISO convention established by
`migrations/009`.

## 8. Vendor Endpoint Sync

Apps with a `metadata_url` (Microsoft publishes M365 endpoint
ranges, Google publishes Workspace SPF + IP lists, etc.) are
auto-refreshed by a periodic sync job
(`internal/service/appdb/sync.go`). The job:

1. Fetches the vendor URL on a 24h cadence.
2. Diffs the new endpoint set against the stored one.
3. On non-empty diff, **unions** the vendor-published entries with
   the existing `domains` / `ip_ranges` and stamps `updated_at`.
   The merge is additive-only by design: a vendor removal does NOT
   automatically shrink the stored set. This prevents a poisoned
   or buggy vendor response (empty payload, rate-limited, MITM)
   from silently wiping the trusted domain list for an app. Stale
   entries are handled by the demotion engine (threat-feed signal
   → immediate `inspect_full` demotion) or manual operator pruning
   via the admin API (`PUT /admin/app-registry/{id}` or
   `DELETE /admin/app-registry/{id}`).
4. Emits an `app.synced` audit + webhook event so operators see
   trust-list movements without polling.

A failed sync does not invalidate the existing classification —
edges continue to use the last good list. Sustained sync
failures (≥ 3 attempts) fire `app.sync_failed` so the operator
can investigate.

## 9. Integration with the Policy Compiler

During bundle compilation on the control plane
(`internal/service/policy/service.go::Compile`), the policy
compiler calls
`appdb.Service.CompileSteeringRules(tenantID, targetType)` and
embeds the resulting `SteeringRuleSet` into the bundle envelope
under the `steering` section. Each enforcement target sees
the steering rules relevant to *its* enforcement domain:

- `edge` and `cloud` bundles receive the full SWG bypass list +
  full URL-cat skip list + SD-WAN app-class mapping.
- `endpoint` bundles receive DNS verification lists and the
  per-class steering decisions.
- `mobile` bundles receive only ZTNA destinations.

The compiler treats the steering section as deterministic
input: the bytes are sorted before serialisation so a no-op
recompile produces a byte-identical bundle and the agent's
ETag / If-None-Match short-circuit keeps holding.

## 10. Telemetry Visibility

Every flow event the edge / agent emits carries the
`traffic_class` it was steered into on the wire `Envelope`
(`schema.Envelope.TrafficClass`, single source of truth — the
field is shared across DNS / HTTP / ZTNA events, not duplicated
inside per-class payload structs). The ClickHouse `sng_telemetry`
table grows three hoisted columns — `traffic_class`
(`LowCardinality(String)`), `bytes_in` and `bytes_out` (`UInt64`)
— and the `ORDER BY` includes the class so per-tenant cost
dashboards can roll up by class without a full scan. Hoisting
bytes onto dedicated columns lets aggregation queries SUM them
directly; the previous JSON-extraction path against the
MessagePack `payload` blob always returned zero.

Operators see, per tenant:

- Bytes per class per day.
- Apps generating the most `inspect_full` traffic (candidates
  for promotion).
- Cert-pin / IP-range mismatch counts (candidates for
  investigation).

This visibility feeds the AI policy-tightening suggestions on
the control plane: *"App Foo accounts for 15% of your
`inspect_full` traffic and has been clean for 90 days; promote
to `trusted_direct`?"*

## 11. Failure Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `app_registry_overrides` row created with invalid `traffic_class_override` | Rejected at API boundary (DB CHECK constraint + service-layer validation). |
| `app_registry` row drift between vendor endpoint list and stored value | Detected by the sync job; corrected on next successful pull. Edges keep using last good list. |
| Demotion engine cannot reach NATS | Demotion still records in `audit_log` and `app_registry_overrides`; receivers pick it up at the next bundle pull (slower but consistent). |
| Resolver returns SERVFAIL for a `trusted_*` domain | Flow falls back to `inspect_full` (fail-closed). |
| Cert chain hash not in `cert_pins` | Flow demoted to `inspect_full`; `cert_pin_mismatch` event recorded. |
| Destination IP not in `ip_ranges` | Flow demoted to `inspect_full`; `ip_range_mismatch` event recorded. |
| Steering bundle compile fails | Policy compile returns an error; previous bundle stays live (atomic swap). Operator is paged via the existing policy-compile-failure alert. |
