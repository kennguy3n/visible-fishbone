//! The OIDC `AuthSession` the agent depends on, built from
//! `sng-oidc`.
//!
//! `sng-mobile-core` orchestrates the agent against the
//! [`AuthSession`] trait but ships no concrete implementation;
//! `sng-oidc` provides the protocol pieces (discovery, PKCE, code
//! exchange, ID-token validation, [`OidcSession`] with auto-refresh)
//! but knows nothing of that trait. This module is the **glue**
//! between them — it is the one place the SDK adds behaviour, and it
//! adds only adaptation, never new protocol logic:
//!
//! * [`OidcAuthSession`] is an [`AuthSession`] whose token state is
//!   an `Option<OidcSession>` — `None` until the user signs in,
//!   `Some` afterwards. Before sign-in every token request returns
//!   the typed [`AuthError::Unauthenticated`] the agent already
//!   knows how to surface.
//! * [`OidcAuthSession::sign_in`] drives the full
//!   authorization-code-with-PKCE flow once, using the
//!   platform-injected [`AuthSurface`] (iOS
//!   `ASWebAuthenticationSession`, Android Custom Tabs, or the host
//!   fallback) to present the browser leg, then installs the
//!   resulting [`OidcSession`].
