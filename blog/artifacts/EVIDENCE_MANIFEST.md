# SNG Wave 2 — Evidence Manifest & Provenance Index

This manifest is the hand-off to the Wave 3 blog rewrite. Every number in the
rewritten posts must trace back to an artifact listed here. Nothing in this set
is hand-edited: each payload is a real control-plane API response, each report
is real harness output, each screenshot is a real CDP capture of the live
console.

## 1. Capture context

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Repo HEAD | `c3d99ce420d39ad50f557543610491dc26f1876a` (`c3d99ce`) |
| Latest migration | `067_dlp_edm_datasets` (C2 EDM); `066_capability_rollout` (P1) below it |
| Stack | Postgres 16 + NATS 2.10 (Docker) · `sng-control` on :8080 · vite console on :5173 (proxy → :8080) |
| Capture window | 2026-06-12 15:19–15:27 UTC |
| Host | `devin-box` — 8 vCPU AMD EPYC 7763 (AVX2/FMA, no AVX-512/VNNI), 31 GiB RAM, CPU-only |
| Fleet | 9 tenants, 4 residencies/industries (see §3) |
| Feature flags this run | `CASB_NOOPS_ENABLED=true` (recommend-only, `NOOPS_AUTO_ENFORCE=false`); rollout gates driven off→monitor→enforce per §4; nftables installed → `firewall_kernel` scored |

All payloads flow through the real operator API (JWT auth, RLS tenant scoping,
policy compilation, audit log) — the seed/usage/capture harnesses drive the same
endpoints a human operator would, so every row is enforcement-path-authentic.

## 2. Harness results (the load-bearing numbers)

### 2.1 Security efficacy — `efficacy-report.json`
- **Source:** `bench/efficacy` (real enforcement code over known-bad/known-good + adversarial + wild corpora). Run with `--firewall --firewall-kernel --swg --ztna --ips --dlp --malware --dns --adversarial --wild`, `git=c3d99ce`, ONNX Runtime 1.22 for the ML-NER leg, Suricata for IPS, nftables for the kernel leg.
- **Overall verdict: PASS.** Gating rows (all PASS): firewall, **firewall_kernel** (kernel nft ruleset accepted by `nft -c`), swg, ztna 100%; dlp 100% (2400/2400), dlp_ml_ner 97.4% catch / 97.9% acc; malware, dns, ips 100%; **malware_adversarial 100%** (42 bad), **ips_adversarial 100%**.
- **Informational (wild, never gates):** `malware_wild` catch **90.1%** / FPR **9.6%** / precision 73.1% (WARN — honest misses on packed/novel); `dlp_wild` 100% catch / 0% FPR; `ips_wild` 100%. Wild corpus: 2,087 samples (457 malicious / 1,630 benign ≈ 22%), seed `0x53475744`, sha256 `07b2e837ed62`, schema `sng-wild-corpus/v1`.
- **Hot-path throughput:** ztna 1,781,586 decisions/s (561 ns/op); dlp_ml_ner 20,197 scans/s; dlp_wild 802,762 scans/s under 8-thread load.
- **Closes caveats:** §3 "firewall kernel leg unverified", §3 "no adversarial/evasion corpus", §3 "curated corpora not wild traffic / no FPR under load", §5 "corpus is synthetic" (now adds a noisy blended corpus with published FPR).

### 2.2 Multi-queue throughput — `multiqueue-micro.json`
- **Source:** `sng-bench multi-queue --profile skus/micro --mode full-stack --backend nftables`.
- **Single-stream floor 5.451 Gbps → 16-queue ceiling 25.976 Gbps (4.77×).** Per-width: 1q 5.451 (100%), 2q 10.427 (96%), 4q 19.874 (91%), 8q 25.008 (57%), 16q 25.976 (30%) on 8 cores.
- **Closes caveats:** §1 "wire numbers are a single-stream floor" (now shown as a floor→ceiling curve), §7 "why is firewall 5.5 == IPS 5.5" (the single-stream wire is a per-frame syscall ceiling, not an inspection bound; CPU headroom is exposed by fanning out).

### 2.3 8B LLM validation — `payloads/s6-llm-validation-bonsai-8b-q2_0.json` + `llm_validation/quality_report.{json,md}`
- **Source:** P3 (#203) live run of `blog/harness/llm_validation` against the self-hosted **Ternary-Bonsai-8B Q2_0** (prism AVX2-repack kernels), committed. Re-confirmed live on THIS VM in deterministic-only mode (20 queries, classification/verifier/fallback **100%**).
- **8B numbers (live inference, identical 8-vCPU EPYC profile):** parse 100%, verifier 100%, classification 100%, fallback-agreement 100%; **latency p50 8,948 ms / p95 10,793 ms** (≈7.6× faster than the pre-repack Q2_0 path).
- **Closes caveats:** §6 "CI validates a small stand-in model, not the 8B at scale" (now a real 8B run with a published latency table), §6 "pinned Q2_0 needs custom kernels" (documented + measured on the prism build).

### 2.4 Fleet cost & margin — `payloads/s7-admin-cost-report.json`
- **Source:** `GET /api/v1/admin/cost-report`, re-captured 2026-06-12T15:43Z after a **clean full re-seed** of `blog/harness/usage` (TRUNCATE + reseed so every tenant carries current + 5-month history; the first Wave-2 capture skipped history on tenants that already had current rows, which corrupted both the anomaly baseline and the fleet totals — superseded here).
- **9-tenant fleet:** revenue $8,191.00/mo · projected cost **≈$4,056/mo** · **margin ≈$4,135 (≈50%)**. Per-tenant margin spans **≈+66.6% (Globex)** down to **≈−14.8% (Maple Health)** — Maple is the deliberate *underwater* tenant (professional $499 tier consuming enterprise-scale bandwidth/ClickHouse → projected ≈$573/mo), the honest upsell/margin signal the report is built to surface. The 4-tenant base cohort (Globex ≈$667, Acme ≈$1,060, Umbrella ≈$57, Initech ≈$425) totals ≈$2,210/mo, reproducing the canonical reconciled figures from #196. **Note on precision:** these are *projected* (elapsed-fraction-extrapolated) figures, so they drift sub-percent within a billing period — successive captures land at e.g. Maple −14.8% / −14.9% / −15.1% and fleet 50.3–50.5%. The saved payload is the point-in-time source of record; prose uses approximate figures deliberately.
- **Cost anomaly (real):** Initech's `url_cat_lookups` projects **$224.97 vs a $72.31 5-month baseline = ratio 3.111, severity `warning`** (`s7-initech-cost-anomalies.json`) — a modelled mid-period traffic surge the detector flags while Initech still clears its $499 tier. Acme's anomaly set is empty (control). This is the detector firing on real seeded history, not a hand-written example.
- **Closes caveats:** §7 "cost report tenant_count: 4" (now 9, fleet-wide, with a genuine loss-making tenant rather than an all-green table).

## 3. The 9-tenant fleet (residency × industry coverage)

| Tenant | Tier | Residency | Industry | Margin % |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Globex Health Systems | enterprise | US (us-west) | health | ≈66.6 |
| Acme Retail Group | enterprise | US (us-east) | retail | ≈47.0 |
| Britannia Robotics | enterprise | GB (eu-west-2) | robotics | ≈62.4 |
| Umbrella Logistics | starter | SG (ap-southeast) | logistics | ≈42.4 |
| Nordic EduCloud | starter | SE (eu-north-1) | education | ≈53.9 |
| Lumière Légal | professional | FR (eu-west-3) | legal | ≈55.3 |
| Outback Retail | professional | AU (ap-southeast-2) | retail | ≈49.3 |
| Initech Financial | professional | EU (eu-central-1) | financial | ≈14.8 |
| Maple Health | professional | CA (ca-central-1) | health | ≈−14.8 |

## 4. Rollout staging exercised (off→monitor→enforce)

`payloads/rollout-{acme,globex,initech}-states.json` + `rollout-acme-clamav-enforce-transition.json`.
- **Acme:** `clamav_swg` → **enforce** (full ladder off→monitor→enforce), `noops_autoenforce` → monitor, `idp_directory_sync` off.
- **Globex:** `clamav_swg` → monitor, `idp_directory_sync` → monitor.
- **Initech:** `clamav_swg` → enforce.
- **Closes caveat:** §5 "four new capabilities not wired into the running control plane" (ClamAV/NoOps/IdP-sync are now live behind the staged-enablement gate, with real per-tenant state).

## 5. Payload index (`payloads/`, 61 files)

### New-module captures (this run, 1568×993 CDP)
| File | Route | What it proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `new-cross-tenant-rollout.png` | `/policy/rollout` | guided "apply one baseline to many tenants" surface listing all 9 tenants + residency — closes §2 "templates are a catalog, not a roll-out UI" |

(`new-scim-provisioning` intentionally omitted — `/scim` is proxied to the backend SCIM endpoint, not an SPA page; C5 evidence is the conformance suite + `SCIM_CERTIFICATION.md`.)

## 7. Caveat-resolution crosswalk (for the rewrite)

| Blog section / caveat | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §1 wire = single-stream floor | **measured both ways** | `multiqueue-micro.json` floor 5.45 → ceiling 25.98 Gbps |
| §2 templates = catalog not roll-out UI | **shipped** | `new-cross-tenant-rollout.png`, `pt-rollout-preview-*` |
| §2 onboarding not wizard-polished | **shipped** | `new-guided-onboarding-wizard.png` |
| §2 no cross-region migration | **shipped (prior)** | `internal/service/tenant/migrate_region.go` (merged) |
| §3 firewall kernel leg unverified | **verified** | `efficacy-report.json` `firewall_kernel` PASS (nft ruleset accepted) |
| §3 no adversarial corpus | **measured** | `malware_adversarial`/`ips_adversarial` 100% |
| §3 curated not wild / no FPR | **measured** | `malware_wild` 90.1%/9.6% FPR, `dlp_wild`, `ips_wild` |
| §4 identity depth / user-subject | **shipped (P2)** | merged #201; behind `ztna.user_subject_eval_enabled` |
| §4 no continuous re-eval | **shipped** | `ReevalLoop` wired (default-OFF) |
| §5 review queue has no operator surface | **shipped** | `new-dlp-review-queue.png`, `s5-acme-dlp-review-*` |
| §5 NoOps/ClamAV/safe-browsing not wired | **wired (staged)** | `new-casb-noops-shadow-it.png`, `rollout-*-states.json` |
| §5 NER 6 classes / no fingerprinting | **expanded (C2)** | 21 jurisdictions + EDM + fingerprints (#209), `s5-acme-dlp-fingerprint-*` |
| §6 stand-in model not 8B | **measured** | `s6-llm-validation-bonsai-8b-q2_0.json` (p50 8.9s / p95 10.8s, 100%) |
| §7 cost report 4-tenant | **fleet-wide** | `s7-admin-cost-report.json` 9 tenants, 50.3% fleet margin (Maple −15.1% underwater) |
| §7 global PoP network | **honest gap** | `deploy/pop/` reference topology + `docs/pop-topology.md` ("software you operate, not a rented network") — the one genuinely unclosed competitive gap |

## 8. Known honest gaps (carry into the rewrite unchanged)
- **Global PoP footprint** vs Zscaler/Cloudflare/Cato: SNG ships software you run, not a rented anycast network. `deploy/pop/` is a reference topology, not a live global edge.
- **Live SCIM certification** vs real Okta/Entra: in-repo hardening + conformance suite + documented cert plan only (no live-tenant cert this cycle, per the product decision).
- **`malware_wild` FPR 9.6%**: real signature engines miss packed/novel samples — published honestly, not smoothed.
